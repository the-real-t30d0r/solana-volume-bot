# Key Features

**XVolume** is a comprehensive Solana Volume Bot and Multi-Buy/Multi-Sell engine that puts you in control of every transaction. Unlike bots that rely on blind randomness, XVolume empowers you to set your own rules, choose your own parameters, and manage your wallets in one streamlined solution.

## Flexible Volume Generation
- **Multi-Wallet Strategy**  
  Easily ramp up trading activity across as many wallets as you like. Create volume in a controlled, human-like pattern or opt for consistent amounts—your call.  
- **Customized Token Metadata**  
  Store coins by name and mint address so you don’t have to remember complicated mints. Quickly add or manage token details in one place.

## Buy Your Way
- **All-In Buy**  
  Allocate the entire SOL balance from a wallet into a single token for maximum impact.  
- **Partial Allocation**  
  Set min and max SOL amounts to maintain leftover funds for fees or future use.  
- **Randomized Range / Max / Static**  
  Three buy modes:  
  - **Random [min..max]** for more realistic, human-like buys  
  - **Max** to use all available (minus leftover)  
  - **Static** to spend a fixed SOL amount  
- **Token Metadata**  
  Pick tokens by name—no need to handle complex mint addresses.

## Sell How You Want
- **All Tokens**  
  Empty out specific SPL token balances in one command—ideal for a swift exit.  
- **Percentage**  
  Decide what percentage to sell for nuanced control.  
- **Random Min..Max**  
  Adds realism by using a random range.  
- **Leftover Principle**  
  Keep some SOL/tokens for fees or sell to zero if you prefer.

---

## Effortless Distribution & Unification
- **Distribute SOL**  
  Send a chosen SOL amount from one wallet to several targets in a single step.  
- **Unify SOL (Even External)**  
  Gather SOL from multiple wallets into one wallet or address, leaving fee behind.  
- **Unify SPL Tokens**  
  Consolidate a chosen token from many wallets into one wallet (or external).

---

## Multi-Buy-Sell Cycle (Trend Simulation)
- **Cycles**  
  Automate repeated (Buy -> Sell) with, for example, 3 cycles.  
- **Artificial Trends**  
  Bigger buys vs. sells => uptrend, or the opposite => downtrend.  
- **Delays & Wait Times**  
  Configure wait times between buy, sell, and cycle actions.  
- **Reuses Same Logic**  
  Random, static, or max amounts—your choice.

## No Blind Randomness
The random factor is entirely optional—use it for a natural look or set a fixed range. You can also skip random for static or max spend.
